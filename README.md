# Python Notebooks for Data Science
---
This repository offers a comprehensive collection of Python notebooks that serve as a detailed guide to key topics in statistics and machine learning for data science applications. 

Each notebook includes clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on coding exercises to reinforce learning. Designed for beginners and learners at any level, these resources cover foundational concepts, step-by-step implementations from scratch, and real-world applications using Scikit-learn. 

Whether you're new to data analysis or looking to enhance your machine learning skills, this repository provides a structured and practical approach to mastering these techniques.

## Used Datasets
This repository includes small to medium-sized datasets in the `datasets` directory, but larger datasets are excluded due to size constraints. For these, source URLs are provided in text file that has the same name of the dataset. Download the missing datasets from the provided URLs and place them in the `datasets` directory to ensure the code runs properly. For any issues, feel free to open an issue.

## Contents

The notebooks are organized into the following categories:

**[101] Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** All notebooks starts with **101** code is the machine leaning and data science.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/heba14101998/Hands-on-Data-with-Python.git


## Usage

To use these notebooks, you'll need Python along with common data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, etc. Each notebook has the necessary import statements.
You can view the notebooks statically on GitHub. However, to modify code and re-run, you'll want to clone or download the repository locally.
